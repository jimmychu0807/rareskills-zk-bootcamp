    "You will need to use python to generate the test cases, but the goal is to write solidity code that leverages the precompiles to accomplish the following:\n",

    "## Problem 1: Rational numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to do zero knowledge addition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim: “I know two rational numbers that add up to num/den”\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: ([A], [B], num, den)\n",
    "\n",

    "\t// return true if the prover knows two numbers that add up to num/den\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidity/EVM has two functions you may find handy: `mulmod` (which does multiplication modulo p) and the precompile `modExp` which does modular exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `modExp` does not let you raise to the power of -1, you can accomplish the same thing by raising a number to `curve_order - 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following identity will be handy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pow(a, -1, curve_order) == pow(a, curve_order - 2, curve_order)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is Fermat’s little theorem, you can ask a chatbot AI to further explain this, but it isn’t necessary to understand this)\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish `pow` the precompile `modExp` may be handy.\n",

    "## Problem 2: Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no claim statement here, just execute the math on chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your contract should implement matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix (**M**) of uint256 and a n x 1 vector of points (**s**). It validates the claim that matrix **Ms = o** where o is a n x 1 matrix of uint256.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to multiply **o** by the generator on-chain so that both sides have the same type.\n",
