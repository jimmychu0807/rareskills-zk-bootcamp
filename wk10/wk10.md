Use a QAP from an earlier homework as a starting point.

The trusted setup should generate the following values:

$$
\tau, \alpha, \beta
$$

which are the “toxic waste” (read this [https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/26/what-is-zcash-the-privacy-coin-explained/](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/26/what-is-zcash-the-privacy-coin-explained/#:~:text=A%20trusted%20setup%20creates%20a,without%20revealing%20what%20it%20was)).

## Notation

Bold letters are vectors

$$
\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle
$$

Is an inner product between vectors **a** and **b**.

$$
[A]_1
$$

Is a G1 point

$$
[B]_2
$$

Is a G2 point

$$
I_{12}
$$

Is the identity in G12

Carry out the following computations in Python:

## Trusted Setup

Generate the powers of tau for A and B:

$$
[\tau^dG_1, \tau^{d-1}G_1,...,\tau G_1, G_1]
$$

$$
[\tau^dG_2, \tau^{d-1}G_2,...,\tau G_2, G_2]
$$

$$
[\dots,\tau^2t(\tau)G_1,\tau t(\tau)G_1,t(\tau)G_1]
$$

$$
\Psi_i=(w_i(\tau)+\alpha v_i(\tau)+\beta u_i(\tau))G_1 \space\space\space\text{for i = 1 to m}
$$

The trusted setup publishes

$$
\begin{align*}[\alpha]_1&=\alpha G_1 \\ [\beta]_2&=\beta G2 \\  \mathbf{\Psi}&=(w_i(\tau)+\alpha v_i(\tau)+\beta u_i(\tau))G_1\vert_{i=1}^m\end{align*}
$$

## Prover

The prover computes their witness vector **a** and computes:

$$
[A]_1 = [\alpha]_1 +\sum_{i=1}^m a_iu_i(\tau)
$$

$$
[B]_2 = [\beta]_2+\sum_{i=1}^m a_i v_i(\tau)
$$

$$
[C]_1 = \sum_{i=0}^m a_i\Psi_i+\langle \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{\eta} \rangle
$$

## Verifier

The verifier computes:

$$
\text{I}_{12}\stackrel{?}{=} \text{neg}([A]_1)\cdot [B]_2+[\alpha]_1\cdot [\beta]_2+[C]_1G_1
$$

If you get very stuck, feel free to refer to past implementations by students (which have been published on GitHub).
